			<h3>Patented Technology</h3>
			<p>
				Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional
				music, including technology to elicit <b>strong neural phase
					locking</b>-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds
				of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in
				sound.
			</p>
			<p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a
				desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create
				music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

			<h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
			<p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic
				institutions to run experiments.</p>
			<p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using
				fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring
				performance on simple games.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Our experiments always include a control condition
					('placebo')</b> of the same underlying music without Brain.fm
				technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the
				difference.
